# Kathar치
Implementation of the notorious [Netkit](https://github.com/maxonthegit/netkit-core) using Python and Docker, allowing for SDN, NFV and traditional routing protocols. Comes with P4, Bind, Quagga, OpenVSwitch and more. 

Kathar치 has the performances to run in production and can emulate most network equipments. 

## Installation
* To run Kathar치 you first need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Python 2.x.
* Download all the files to a directory of your choice (from a release or `git clone`). 
* Add the environment variable NETKIT_HOME to your system pointing to the **bin** folder:
  * Linux: `export NETKIT_HOME=/home/foo/kathara/bin`
  * Windows: System > Advanced settings > Environment Variables > New > ...
    
    You'll also need to share the drive containing labs and the user folder (it can be done from Docker settings, from the tray icon).
* Run the installer:
  * Linux: `$NETKIT_HOME/install` (optionally `--skip-p4` to avoid pre-downloading the P4 image, that may not be needed)
  * Windows: `%NETKIT_HOME%\install`(completely optional, it only pre-downloads images)
* You can optionally add NETKIT_HOME to your PATH

# Manual
The interface of Kathar치 is basically the same we used for Netkit, and it's available here: [Man page of NETKIT](http://wiki.netkit.org/man/man7/netkit.7.html).

The main difference is the way we specify the interfaces in the `vstart` command (now requiring `--eth 0:A --eth 1:B ...`) but why would you ever use `vstart` when you have `lstart`?
