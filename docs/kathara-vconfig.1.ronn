kathara-vconfig(1) -- Attach network interfaces to a running Kathara device
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kathara vconfig` [`-h`] `-n` <DEVICE_NAME> (`--add` <CD> [<CD> ...] \| `--rm` <CD> [<CD> ...])  

## DESCRIPTION

Manage the network interfaces of a running Kathara device. The affected device is identified by <DEVICE_NAME>, which is the name of the running device. 

## OPTIONS

* `-h`, `--help`:
    Show a help message and exit.

* `-n` <DEVICE_NAME>, `--name` <DEVICE_NAME>:
    Name of the device to manage.

* `--add` <CD[/MAC_ADDR]> [<CD[/MAC_ADDR]> ...]:
	Specify the collision domain to be connected to the device:
    + `CD`: The name of the collision domain to which the specified interface must be connected. Note that the name of the collision domain must not contain spaces (" "), commas (",") and dots (".").
    + `/MAC_ADDR`: An optional parameter to specify the MAC address of the interface of `pc1` (MAC address must be in the format `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`). If `MAC_ADDR` is not provided, Kathar√° will assign a random one. 
    
    Equip the device with an additional network interface attached to a (virtual) collision domain whose name is <CD>. 
    The number of the resulting network interface is generated incrementing the number of the last network interface used by the device.

* `--rm` <CD> [<CD> ...]:
	Specify the collision domain to be disconnected from the device.

    Disconnect the device from the collision domain whose name is <CD> and remove the corresponding interface.

## EXAMPLES

Connect `pc1` to collision domain `X` and `Y` (with random MAC addresses):
    
    kathara vconfig -n pc1 --add X Y

Connect `pc1` to collision domain `X` with the specified MAC address:
    
    kathara vconfig -n pc1 --add X/00:00:00:00:00:01

Disconnect `pc1` from collision domain `X` and remove the corresponding interface:
    
    kathara vconfig -n pc1 --rm X
